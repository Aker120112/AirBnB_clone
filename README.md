# AirBnB Clone - Step 1

Welcome to the first step in building your AirBnB clone web application! This foundational step is crucial as it will lay the groundwork for all subsequent projects. You'll be utilizing what you build here throughout the project, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

## Objectives

In this step, you'll focus on:

- **Setting up a BaseModel class**: This class will handle initialization, serialization, and deserialization of your instances.
- **Creating a simple serialization/deserialization flow**: The process will include Instance ↔ Dictionary ↔ JSON string ↔ File.
- **Building classes for AirBnB**: Develop classes such as User, State, City, Place, etc., which will inherit from BaseModel.
- **Implementing a storage engine**: Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project, File Storage.
- **Writing unit tests**: Validate all your classes and the storage engine with comprehensive unit tests.

## Command Interpreter

Think of this as a simplified Shell, but tailored for specific use cases. The command interpreter will allow you to:

- **Create new objects**: For example, a new User or Place.
- **Retrieve objects**: From files, databases, etc.
- **Perform operations on objects**: Such as counting, computing statistics, etc.
- **Update object attributes**: Modify properties as needed.
- **Destroy objects**: Remove objects from the system.

Happy coding!
